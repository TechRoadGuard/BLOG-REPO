<h3>1. Dubrovnik: The Jewel of the Adriatic</h3>
<p>Dubrovnik, often referred to as the "Pearl of the Adriatic," is one of the most famous cities in Croatia, and for good reason. Its Old Town is a UNESCO World Heritage site, surrounded by massive stone walls that have stood for centuries. As you wander through the winding streets, you'll feel like you've stepped into another world—one of medieval charm, sun-soaked terraces, and sweeping views of the ocean.</p>
